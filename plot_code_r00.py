# 5 Discussion
#You must contribute a short (1-2 paragraph) written justification of how your visualization addresses your stated research question.

# I am very interested in the level of overseas price of Korean automobile companies like Hyundai Motor Company.
# In particular, I am curious about used car price. I want to know the difference in price with Japanese cars.
# First, we checked how the current status of used car prices has changed since 2019.
# As a result of the confirmation, it was confirmed that the used car price was increasing compared to 2019, and it was confirmed that the used car price of Genesis was on the rise from the decreasing trend.
# And we compared the differences with Japanese cars. As a result of checking the overall price level with boxplot, it was confirmed that Japanese cars are slightly higher than Korean cars.
# However, in the case of Lexus, it has been confirmed that used car prices are on the decline.
# This result shows that the level of Korean cars is getting better than before.

# I think there may be a relationship between the weather and car price
# so I checked about the correlation between the weather and used car price of Hyundai Motor Company in South Lyon, Michigan, United States.
# First, check the weather in Michigan. It was an area with good weather from -5 degrees to 25 degrees.
# And the weather and car prices were summarized by month, and a double-axis graph was drawn and checked. As a result of checking, it was found that the price of used cars increased as time passed. Therefore, correlation analysis was performed additionally.
# Before the correlation analysis, normalization was performed for each variable, and when checking the analysis results, Korean cars showed a correlation with temperature, but Japanese cars did not. I think that further confirmation is needed as to why this result came out.
